## **Welcome to Edu-Lab**

Edu-Lab is a supportive, inclusive, and fun learning center for students ages K-12th grade. Edu-Lab helps motivate students to learn by providing a supportive Google Cloud AI chat bot who is eager to hear about your day at school and motivates you to continue learning when you are feeling discouraged. Using a trained AI model developed by the team, Edu-Bot aims to help students of all different backgrounds in their educational endevours. We specifically target our bot to support children who historically have a more difficult time learning in school such as underrepresented minority students, women, LGBTQ+ community, and students who have difficult home situations.

To compliment the web app, we offer text services that send motivational messages to keep you feeling confident in your school performance.

## **The Background**

It can be exceptionally difficult for students to stay motivated to do well in school. Many students start developing negative thoughts towards school as early as elementary school. Notably, it is even more difficult for students of lower income families, minority groups, strained home situationships, among other situations that can detract from ones education. With Edu-Lab, we searched up the reasons why students have trouble in school and catered our solutions towards motivating fixes that show students the importannce of education while not putting too much pressure on them.

## **The Team**

Edu-Lab was created by Russell Lee, Alex Li, Zach Lieberman, and Emily Buerk.

## **Tools**

This app was created using Django and launched with Heroku. The sign in page is created with Google Cloud to create users and allow them customization options. To implement the Edu-Bot, we trained a Google Cloud AI Bot according to our customized database of potential conversations that could be had with Edu-Bot. The text service is set up with Twilio.
